{"data": ["Anger begets more anger, and forgiveness and love lead to more forgiveness and love. Mahavira", "Love God; love others; do your best in all you do, even if you fall short! Bethany Hamilton", "If we went by the world's definition of who I'm supposed to be because I look weird... 'Well, surely, this guy can't have a productive life, surely, he doesn't have a sense of humor. Surely, he can't love life.' We stereotype people in this world. And so... if the world thinks you're not good enough, it's a lie, you know. Get a second opinion. Nick Vujicic", "We write for the same reason that we walk, talk, climb mountains or swim the oceans - because we can. We have some impulse within us that makes us want to explain ourselves to other human beings. That's why we paint, that's why we dare to love someone - because we have the impulse to explain who we are. Maya Angelou", "Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind. William Shakespeare", "A kiss is a secret told to the mouth instead of the ear; kisses are the messengers of love and tenderness. Ingrid Bergman", "You might not make it to the top, but if you are doing what you love, there is much more happiness there than being rich or famous. Tony Hawk", "Love yourself, whatever makes you different, and use it to make you stand out. Mine is my voice and the fact that I'm gay: well, the fact that I'm flamboyantly gay. Ross Mathews", "The more often we see the things around us - even the beautiful and wonderful things - the more they become invisible to us. That is why we often take for granted the beauty of this world: the flowers, the trees, the birds, the clouds - even those we love. Because we see things so often, we see them less and less. Joseph B. Wirthlin", "Diamonds have an image of purity and light. They are given as a pledge of love and worn as a symbol of commitment. Peter Singer"]}
