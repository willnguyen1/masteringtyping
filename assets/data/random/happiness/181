{"data": ["Fun I love, but too much fun is of all things the most loathsome. Mirth is better than fun, and happiness is better than mirth.", "Happiness in this world, when it comes, comes incidentally. Make it the object of pursuit, and it leads us a wild-goose chase, and is never attained. Follow some other object, and very possibly we may find that we have caught happiness without dreaming of it."]}
