{"data": ["Try to make at least one person happy every day. If you cannot do a kind deed, speak a kind word. If you cannot speak a kind word, think a kind thought. Count up, if you can, the treasure of happiness that you would dispense in a week, in a year, in a lifetime! Lawrence G. Lovasik", "Happiness is a by-product. You cannot pursue it by itself. Sam Levenson", "If happiness truly consisted in physical ease and freedom from care, then the happiest individual would not be either a man or a woman; it would be, I think, an American cow. William Lyon Phelps", "My travels led me to where I am today. Sometimes these steps have felt painful, difficult, but led me to greater happiness and opportunites. Diana Ross", "If I have to apply five turns to the screw each day for the happiness of Argentina, I will do it. Evita Peron", "Friendship improves happiness and abates misery, by the doubling of our joy and the dividing of our grief. Marcus Tullius Cicero", "Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know. Ernest Hemingway", "It is not how much we have, but how much we enjoy, that makes happiness. Charles Spurgeon", "There is no worse sorrow than remembering happiness in the day of sorrow. Alfred de Musset", "Happiness must be cultivated. It is like character. It is not a thing to be safely let alone for a moment, or it will run to weeds. Elizabeth Stuart Phelps"]}
