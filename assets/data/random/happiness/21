{"data": ["Happiness in this world, when it comes, comes incidentally. Make it the object of pursuit, and it leads us a wild-goose chase, and is never attained. Follow some other object, and very possibly we may find that we have caught happiness without dreaming of it. Nathaniel Hawthorne", "Now and then it's good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy. Guillaume Apollinaire", "That is happiness; to be dissolved into something complete and great. Willa Cather", "For happiness one needs security, but joy can spring like a flower even from the cliffs of despair. Anne Morrow Lindbergh", "You must try to generate happiness within yourself. If you aren't happy in one place, chances are you won't be happy anyplace. Ernie Banks", "I always seem to have a vague feeling that he is a Satan among musicians, a fallen angel in the darkness who is perpetually seeking to fight his way back to happiness. Havelock Ellis", "What we call the secret of happiness is no more a secret than our willingness to choose life. Leo Buscaglia", "When what we are is what we want to be, that's happiness. Malcolm Forbes", "In theory there is a possibility of perfect happiness: To believe in the indestructible element within one, and not to strive towards it. Franz Kafka", "When we recall the past, we usually find that it is the simplest things - not the great occasions - that in retrospect give off the greatest glow of happiness. Bob Hope"]}
