Daniel Kahneman", "It's nonsense to say money doesn't buy happiness, but people exaggerate the extent to which more money can buy more happiness. Daniel Kahneman", "Happiness is very simple and minimal. Tablo", "My idea of absolute happiness is to be in bed on a rainy day, with my blankie, my cat, and my dog. Anne Lamott", "We all have a hungry heart, and one of the things we hunger for is happiness. So as much as I possibly could, I stayed where I was happy. Mary Oliver", "I think most of us are raised with preconceived notions of the choices we're supposed to make.
