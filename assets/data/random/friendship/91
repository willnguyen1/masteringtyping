{"data": ["Nothing so fortifies a friendship as a belief on the part of one friend that he is superior to the other.", "It is one of the severest tests of friendship to tell your friend his faults. So to love a man that you cannot bear to see a stain upon him, and to speak painful truth through loving words, that is friendship."]}
