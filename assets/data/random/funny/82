Bring another funny character with a funny hat on his head. Christopher Guest is more the line of trying to get a story out. Fred Willard", "I've been called a funny person for a long time.

Ethan Coen", "My wife and I will often have conversations about 'Good Times' and 'The Jeffersons' and 'Sanford and Son.'

Yet 99 per cent of comics look and talk exactly the same. Bo Burnham", "I became good friends with Jack Whitehall. I think he's great, such a great dude, and really funny. Bo Burnham", "Comedy is a tool of togetherness. It's a way of putting your arm around someone, pointing at something, and saying, 'Isn't it funny that we do that?' It's a way of reaching out.
