Anne Lamott", "I actually think of being funny as an odd turn of mind, like a mild disability, some weird way of looking at the world that you can't get rid of. Calvin Trillin", "Do you know, it's funny, but I never thought of being blind as a disadvantage, and I never thought of being black as a disadvantage. Stevie Wonder", "One of the things I like about acting is that, in a funny way, I come back to myself. Bill Murray", "I think we're all good and bad, but good's not funny. Bad is funny.

Joan Jett", "It's funny: I'm a lifelong musician, but because I principally play the piano it's been a solitary thing. Gary Oldman", "It's funny, because when you're younger you're in a rush to be 18 or 21 or whatever. But then you hit 30. And now, the days go by like hours.
