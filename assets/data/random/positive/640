You can choose to look on the positive side and enjoy whatever roles you're given. You can find the silver lining in anything.", "I'm one of five sisters. I'm the younger of twins, and we're the youngest of five girls, and we've always been very close. We were pretty much a gang. I take after my mother a lot in terms of personality and character. She was very positive; always looked on the bright side of things. She had a tough time of it with my dad but did her best."]}
