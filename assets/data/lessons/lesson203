Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets. So love the people who treat you right, forget about the ones who don't and believe that everything happens for a reason. If you get a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it. Nobody said that it'd be easy, they just promised it would be worth it.
Many people in today's society waste a lot of their time on social media and entertainment to stimulate themselves but spend little to no time at all trying to improve themselves or their life situation.
